# Conclusion
See the live result : https://erambeau.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/

According to my Toggl report, I clocked 6 hours & 30 minutes on this project, which is my first using CSS grid & personnalization.
I reached by goals about applying CSS Grid & customing colors, logos, fonts.
I'm less sure about responsive design. Well, it _does_ work when growing or reducing window, of when zooming or dezooming, on desktop. But I think it is still possible to make efforts in order to pimp all of those. Moreover, I'm stil not satisfied of the result of mobile. I think there will be more lessons on it, so I don't put so much efforts on it now. 

# Specific learnings
* Switching between flexbox and CSS grid
* Take the habit to use vh & vw instead of px
* UX and the hovering of items. I had a lot of fun to custom my items with a specific behavior.
* The use of variables for colors. It's fabulous.
* The property "filter" to apply.... well, filters on an image. BTW, this website is awesome to generate filters for a specific color : https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp
* Background image & transparency :)
* The hr tag for a line is buggy in a flexbox. You have to use width: 100%;. Thx https://stackoverflow.com/a/34365325


# What I could do better
* Better use of flexbox & grid. I changed my mind several times to switch from flexbox to grid.
* Improve my skills in responsive design using properties min-.., max-..., minmax, ...
* Define a page for both desktop AND mobile
* Define variables at the beginning of my development, not only for colors, but for margin / padding too. And of course use these variables.
* I think it could be a best practice to apply padding on containters instead of margin of content. This, in order to synchronize the visualisation of all containers between them. I faced some issues about this, seeking for a value I passed previously in a parallel container.
* ... and probably still a lot of things that I will discover during my journey !

# Next step ?
